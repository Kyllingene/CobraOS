Rules for the filename text zone:
  1: If you want to do a file within the folder containing this file, do the
extension out of that folder. Ex: 'TextFiles\\Text Editor\\instructions.txt'
  2: Include the extension (.txt, .json, .py)
  3: Make all backslashes double. Otherwise, it could be seen as a truncated escape code, throwing an error.
